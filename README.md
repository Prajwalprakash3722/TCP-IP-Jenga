# TCP IP Jenga: Network Lab Adventures

In this repository, you'll find a collection of labs, exercises, and code samples that will help you hone your networking and security skills for NPS LAb 5th Semester.

So, go ahead and explore. I hope you learn something new, make some friends, and most importantly, have fun! If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to open an issue. And if you find any bugs, please report them using the "bug" label (or just blame it on the gremlins).

Each folder contains a README.md file that has the excercise question.
