# TCP IP Jenga: Network Lab Adventures

In this repository, you'll find a collection of labs, exercises, and code samples that will help you hone your networking and security skills for NPS LAb 5th Semester.

So, go ahead and explore. I hope you learn something new, make some friends, and most importantly, have fun! If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to open an issue. And if you find any bugs, please report them using the "bug" label (or just blame it on the gremlins).

Each folder contains a README.md file that has the excercise question.

- Implement a client and server communication using sockets programming.
- Write a program to implement distance vector routing protocol for a simple topology of routers.
- Write a program to implement error detection and Correction concept using Checksum and Hamming code.
- Implement a simple multicast routing mechanism.
- Write a program to implement concurrent chat server that allows current logged in users to communicate one with other.
- Implementation of concurrent and iterative echo server using both connection and connectionless socket system calls.
- Implementation of remote command execution using socket system calls.
- Write a program to encrypt and decrypt the data using RSA and Exchange the key securely using Diffie-Hellman Key exchange protocol.
